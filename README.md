1. When your cursor is in the input and you press the SHIFT key, what events get triggered? Is keypress one of them?
Why or why not?

2. Holding down the SHIFT key and the pressing the A key, what event fire? 
Did everything happen in the order you expected? 
How does the event object passed to the callback for the keyboard events differ between pressing the A key by itself and with the SHIFT key pressed down.

3. With some text already in the box, press the DELETE/BACKSPACE key to delete a character. 
Do you expect the events to be the same as or different from the examples above?

4. Add another input to the page. Now place your cursor in one of them and press the TAB key. 
The cursor should go to the other input. 
Which events get fired and in what order when you press the TAB key? Are those all the events you were expecting?uu
